## What is mearning learning

Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

E.g., Alaphgo

**E** is the experience of games alphgo played

**P** is the winning probability 

**T** is the task of playing go games
