## Introduction

`Design Patterns` are general architectural solutions. Following `Design Patterns` could speed up the development of robust applications.

## Solid Design Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SSR)

A Class will do one thing only.

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

Class should be open to extension, but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Any places use the parent class could be replaced by subtype class without errors.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Segregate interfaces to small interfaces rather than using one big interface.
